# brotherMap
Code for updating and creating the brother map

What's up guys. Probably gonna just use my geocodio API key [0c410ad5ac00a2e7a055ade70475c465605a6ed] to to geocode addresses into Lat, Lon. Then take these and create a .geojson file to feed into maphub. I feel like this a good first step. Python is probably the best choice for this, and thats what we'll be using. I'll set up a few container files (maybe, not this weekend, super busy) that we can fill in if you want, or just run with this and I can look over it and provide guidance.
